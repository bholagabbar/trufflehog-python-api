# 17480 Final Project
  17-480 Final Project Repository. Building an API over the [truffleHog](https://github.com/dxa4481/truffleHog/) library.

## Folder structure

- `api/`: Folder contains the API source and client code. Includes all the drafts as well.
- `docs/`: Contains all of the documents about requirements, as well as other deliverables (such as the work
           summary and design rationalle)

## Setup
* `virtualenv -p python3 venv` if you do not have a venv for the project.
* `source venv/bin/activate` activates the virtual env.
* `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs dependencies required for API, including truffleHog itself.

## Requirements

* As a security engineer, I want to use the trufflehog library API in my security webservice to find secrets in my repositories.
* As a security engineer, I want to find secrets only in a subset of my repositories, some of which are private for a security audit of the company.
* As a security engineer, I want the results of these finding summarized and dumped somewhere so I can alert corresponding stakeholders via a webhook or alert
